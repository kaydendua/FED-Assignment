Stall Management:
    The Stall Management page acts as the central hub for daily operations, featuring a real-time order queue that allows vendors to track incoming requests with precision. Vendors can manage the entire lifecycle of an order through an intuitive interface, giving them the ability to accept valid orders, decline those that cannot be fulfilled, and mark items as ready for collection to notify customers. To maintain an organized workflow during peak hours, the system includes search functionality and status filters, ensuring that specific orders are easily retrievable. Beyond order processing, this module provides full control over the digital menu. Vendors can effortlessly add new dishes using a modal interface, update pricing, or remove obsolete items. Additionally, an instant availability toggle allows stall owners to mark items as "Unavailable" when sold out immediately without permanently deleting them from the database.

Stall Analytics:
    This page empowers vendors with data-driven insights to monitor financial performance and operational compliance. It prominently displays key metrics such as the total sales revenue for the current month and the stall’s government-assigned hygiene grade, ensuring important figures are always visible. To assist in long-term planning, the page integrates a dynamic bar chart that visualizes sales revenue trends over the past 12 months, helping vendors identify seasonal patterns. Furthermore, a doughnut chart breaks down the top five best-selling items, offering a clear visual representation of customer preferences that can guide inventory management and promotional strategies.

Customer Satisfaction:
    The Customer Satisfaction page is designed to help vendors build trust and maintain quality by aggregating user feedback into a digestible format. It calculates and presents an overall average star rating, giving vendors a quick benchmark of their performance. To provide deeper context, a sentiment distribution chart visualizes the exact volume of reviews across different star levels, allowing owners to see the ratio of positive to negative feedback at a glance. Beneath these metrics lies a scrollable review feed that lists recent customer comments complete with timestamps and individual ratings, enabling vendors to review specific customer experiences and address potential service gaps.

Profile:
    The Profile section provides a secure and user-friendly interface for vendors to manage their account details and personal information. It displays verified identity data, including the vendor's name, email address, and assigned stall location, while offering inline editing tools for updating contact numbers and display names directly. Security is a priority, evidenced by a masked password field that includes a toggle option for visibility, ensuring credentials are protected from prying eyes. The page also handles session management, providing a secure logout function that clears local storage and safely redirects the user to the login screen.
